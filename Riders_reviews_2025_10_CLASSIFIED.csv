I tried to go back in the app to remove my card and shut the account down but it wouldn't let me bypass a tip or rating for the driver. I tried to give a four-star but it gave me all these negative options for a four-star. A four-star is not a bad rating. It would not take away the negative options until I gave a five star which I think is just ridiculous.,1,4.601.10001,29-10-2025 13:14,,,Uber,2025,10,Negative,,Surge & High Fare,,,Unresponsive/Slow Support,,

Turns out UBER does NOT give you receipts or acknowledge that you rode with them with the amount you paid in cash. I spoke to their customer service and exchanged multiple emails but all they respond is that they can't ADJUST receipts. This is unprofessional and rude. all I was asking for was a receipt for what I paid for. How can you not give a customer a valid receipt or invoice?,0,,27-10-2025 19:15,,,Uber,2025,10,Negative,,Toll/Extra Charge Dispute,,,Unresponsive/Slow Support,,

I have several drivers hide around the corner so there close enough to look like they arrived so they get money as if they waited the 5 minutes but in reality they will hide around the corner and when you walk to them they'll go around the block. I've lost so much money from these actions cause we pay for so called drivers time they spent.

No matter what you do they drive you back to their help section in their app. The issue is there's very limited choices that you can get help on and if it's outside any of those limited issues there is no way to get your issue resolved. Also their AI chat is horrible.

Now what it needs is an option to remove # from said list. Now adding multiple stops to a trip is pretty handedly sometimes, but there's no ability to add a set time for either of the extra stops. And sometimes it can take up to 30 minutes to wait for a nearby driver, at worst, which can be annoying past sundown.

Upon waiting for the car it's says driver is late before the app says sorry we can't find a driver before I have to rebook and end up leaving 25mins later for my flight.

It's the driver representing the company and the quality of the service provided.

Overcharges at drop vs when booked 3. Does not let you pay during the trip and you end up paying in cash that you don't have 4. Crashes when viewing your payment methods.....

At last I had to increase the fare amount by 30 rupees only then one driver accepted. Drivers know that the user is going to increase the fare at the end so they do not accept the ride at the base price. This is nothing but robbery.

He took a longer route, stopped at a petrol pump, behaved rudely, and didn’t drop me at my exact location. During payment, the fare suddenly increased to ₹416 plus toll without any message or reason, and after payment, it again showed ₹285 — clearly an overcharge. This was stressful and unfair.
